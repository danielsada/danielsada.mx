Software Development Engineer 💻, B. Eng Computer Science and Technology 📚. I work @ Microsoft in the OneNote in the Sync and Storage Team helping millons of user to access, and enrich their notes 📝. I love C#, Python, Ruby and Typescript.  I am passionate about engineering culture, and how to transform organizations from within, I also love **compilers** and I built [my own compiler](http://github.com/danielsada/deep-lingo) that compiles to CIL or MSIL. I participated on #100DaysOfCode and you can see my progress on [100 Days of Algorithms](http://github.com/danielsada). 

I've worked on OneNote, Chromium Edge, Windows 10X, Microsoft Project Desktop and Project Server. I also worked on eCommerce platforms like Tommy Hilfiger Mexico, Home Depot Mexico, and Office Depot Mexico. I founded [Sadeira](http://sadeira.com) which was a consulting firm in Mexico that specialized in marketing and software.
